fun unitConverter(){
    Column {
        Text("Unit Converter")
        OutlinedTextField(value = "Enter Value", onValueChange = {
        /*Here goes what should happen when user enters input*/
        })
        Row {

        }
    }
}

- The purpose of a preview is to visualize your Composables without running the entire application.

@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun yourFunctionToPreview(){	yourFunctionToPreview()
				}
//This is how you create previews

- You are basically creating an alert (toast), when the button is click it should show you the toast in local context

val context = LocalContext.current

Button(onClick={
	Toast.makeText(context, "Thanks For Clicking", Toast.LENGHT_LONG).show()
})

{Text("click me")}
