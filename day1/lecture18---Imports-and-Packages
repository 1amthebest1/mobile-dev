===============

Every Android app has a unique package name (like com.example.myapp).

This name identifies your app on the device and on Google Play.

Example:

App: WhatsApp → com.whatsapp

App: Instagram → com.instagram.android

Why it matters:

Two apps cannot have the same package name on the same device.

The package name is used internally to manage app updates, permissions, and resources.

===============

every file inside a package, can be used by other files in the package by default.

===============

The import keyword is used to bring classes, interfaces, or entire packages into your file so you can use their code.

Jetpack Compose = modern Kotlin-based toolkit for UI.
