------

MainActivity is the main screen that the Android system launches first, and execution begins in its lifecycle methods (like onCreate()),
not directly in MainActivity itself like a main() function in Kotlin.

------

A module is a buildable unit.

It usually contains multiple packages/folders and many .kt files.

In Android Studio, each module has its own build.gradle (or build.gradle.kts) file.

You can run/compile it independently, or include it in another module.

------

Modifier	Inherited as	Accessible outside class?

public		public		Yes
protected	protected	No
internal	internal	Only same module
private		Not inherited	No

------

In Kotlin, open is a special modifier that controls inheritance and overriding. 
By default, all classes and functions in Kotlin are final, 
which means you cannot inherit from them or override their methods unless you explicitly mark them as open.

------

Visibility (private/protected/public/internal) → controls access

Inheritance (open/final/abstract) → controls extendibility

------

Modifier in Compose ≠ Kotlin modifier keyword.

It’s an object that describes layout, drawing, interaction.

modifier: Modifier = Modifier → parameter with a default value, allowing flexibility.

------

Activity is what you have opened in your screen, so if you change your screen you are going from one activity to another activity.

------

onCreate(){}, means on the creation of this activity, execute the inside of the onactivity(){//execute whatever is here}

------

much like solidity, it has the super keyword, which runs the method of the parent class

------

Surface(), is the background of the app, i think like the canvas in raylib.

------

Modifier.fillMaxSize(), fills the entire screen.

------

color=MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background, it creates a colorscheme, based on the material theme of the application. for example: if you have dark mode turned on it uses a different scheme as compared to light mode.

------

lightgreen text color: means we are talking about composable.

------

Composable is basically an element that you can see on the screen.
